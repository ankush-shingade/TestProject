PhoeniX support
==============================================
Our experienced helpdesk and application engineers are there to help you; if you have any questions
about the PhoeniX software products or how to use them, please contact us and we will be happy to
help you out. For many questions the answers are already on our website, in the FAQ section on the
support pages, see http://www.phoenixbv.com/faq.php.
For more extensive questions or ideaâ€™s about how to use the software, it is a good idea to check out our
applications notes also, they are intended as short-cuts through the applications to give a quick idea of
how to approach certain design or usage issues with the software.

Design support
---------------
If you have an application which is not yet listed on http://www.phoenixbv.com/product.php, but you
think is suitable for general use, please inform us and we can put your (scientific) papers, links to your
documentation or other information there too.
Alternatively we can write new application notes too, which is free of charge but depends on the
amount of time available to our application engineers. For more extensive work please contact us, so we
can find a suitable solution for your software.

How to report problems
------------------------------
In case you encounter troubles while installing PhoeniX Software, please first read the section FAQ on our
