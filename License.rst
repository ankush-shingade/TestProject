License
=========

Introduction
----------------

Our design software is protected with licenses. This chapter provides an overview of PhoeniX Software
licensing.

License types
----------------

There are two license types: ”node locked” and ”floating”. In both cases you will need a hardware
dongle. The dongle contains the licenses and is provided in the box with the CD Rom. For the required
installation steps it is required that you know what license type you have purchased. The delivery note
clearly states this information, in case of uncertainty about what license type you have contact us at
support@phoenixbv.com.

Note: other names used for dongle: USB key, keylock and cmStick.

Node locked
----------------

PhoeniX Software is standardly delivered as ”node locked” software, which means that the software can
be used on one single machine. To enable the PhoeniX Software to work properly the CodeMeter
license software needs to be installed and the cmStick needs to be physically attached to a free USB
port of the computer.

Floating license
--------------------------------

PhoeniX Software can be obtained with a ”floating”. This enables the software to be used
simultaneously at more than one computer connected to the network. The number of concurrent users
is limited to the number of purchased licenses. Therefore the cmStick containing the licenses needs to
be attached to a network server. The PhoeniX Software applications (e.g.: FlowDesigner,
FieldDesigner, MaskEngineer,..) can be installed and run on any computer on the same network. A
PhoeniX Software application will request a license from the network license server, and if the license is
available, it will claim one.
The CodeMeter license software enables this ”floating” functionality in combination with the physically
attached cmStick to the network server. The computer running the applications does not need a
cmStick to be attached in this case.

Note: The IP address of the CodeMeter floating license server can be fixed or variable. The IP address
of the other computers on which the PhoeniX Software runs can also be fixed or variable. The license
server can be found by the PhoeniX Software applications by using a fixed IP address, or by using the
computername of the license server. If you use DNS, this name will be translated into an IP address. You can use a floating IP address for the server as long as its computername will be the same, and you
use DNS to translate the name into the correct IP address. (Your system administrator can tell you
about DNS.)
